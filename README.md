# Earthquake Data Set from USGS

## Introduction

This dataset is sourced from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), an organization that provides reliable scientific information to understand the Earth, mitigate the impact of natural disasters, manage resources, and enhance our quality of life.

As part of its initiatives, the USGS monitors and reports on earthquakes, assesses their impacts and hazards, and conducts targeted research on earthquake causes and effects. The USGS offers real-time notifications, feeds, and web services about earthquakes shortly after they occur. For additional details, you can refer to the [USGS Earthquake Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/).

## Assignment

The project's objective is to produce at least one of the following types of visualizations using Matplotlib:

1. **Bar Graph**
2. **Pie Chart**
3. **Box Plot**
4. **Line Chart**
5. **Scatter Plot**

## Data Analysis and Conclusions

Following the creation of visualizations, an in-depth analysis of the dataset will be conducted. The goal is to identify patterns, correlations, or any noteworthy insights within the earthquake data.
