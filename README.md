# Earthquake Data Set from USGS

## Introduction

This dataset is sourced from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), an organization that provides reliable scientific information to understand the Earth, mitigate the impact of natural disasters, manage resources, and enhance our quality of life.

As part of its initiatives, the USGS monitors and reports on earthquakes, assesses their impacts and hazards, and conducts targeted research on earthquake causes and effects. The USGS offers real-time notifications, feeds, and web services about earthquakes shortly after they occur. For additional details, you can refer to the [USGS Earthquake Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/).
