# Earthquake Data Set from USGS

## Introduction

This dataset is sourced from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), an organization that provides reliable scientific information to understand the Earth, mitigate the impact of natural disasters, manage resources, and enhance our quality of life.

As part of its initiatives, the USGS monitors and reports on earthquakes, assesses their impacts and hazards, and conducts targeted research on earthquake causes and effects. The USGS offers real-time notifications, feeds, and web services about earthquakes shortly after they occur. For additional details, you can refer to the [USGS Earthquake Feed](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/).

The dataset includes information about all earthquakes that occurred in the last 30 days, and it is updated every 15 minutes on the USGS website. I have uploaded this dataset with update settings to weekly levels in Kaggle's Dataset settings. The process follows the instructions provided in [this Kaggle kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/how-to-create-an-auto-updating-dataset-on-kaggle), demonstrating how to create an auto-updating dataset.

## Usage

You can access the dataset on Kaggle. It contains details of earthquakes, including time, location, magnitude, depth, and other relevant parameters.
